	      Learning from demonstration
	      is a growing area of artificial intelligence research that explores
	      techniques for programming autonomous agents (robots) by demonstrating the desired behavior or
	      task. In demonstration-based approaches, a teacher, typically a human, shows the agent
	      how to perform the task. The agent records the demonstrations as sequences of state-
	      action pairs, from which it then learns a policy that reproduces the observed behavior.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Confidence Based Autonomy: A mapping approximation technique based on a classification algorithm. The human teacher (oracle) interacts with the robot by selecting the next action or correcting a past action choice
	      through an on-screen interface. Confidence Based Autonomy is an active learning method that is based on
	      asking for help from a human teacher when needed.
	      
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In most cases making a query to human asking for a classification task is costly in terms of time. My approach towards Confidence Based Autonomy is to use Reinforcement Learning to learn a policy that makes optimal human queries depending on the state of the supervised classifier.

	    <p>
	      According to the PAN 2010 Wikipedia Vandalism Detection training corpus , about 7%
	      of all revisions were vandalized. This is a significant problem for Wikipedia, because the
	      readers can never be sure of the quality of
	      available information, unless they verify it
	      from other sources. The problem
	      is to identify whether a particular edit made
	      to a wikipedia page is legitmiate and not an
	      attempt to compromise the integrity of the
	      page.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      A wiki article from its birth undergoes a series of revision
	      edits and is called as article history. A single revision
	      is a state of the article at a given time in its history
	      and is composed of the textual content, markup and
	      metadata describing the transition from the previous
	      history. A revision metadata contains the user who
	      performed the edit, a comment explaining why the
	      edit was made and describing the changes made to
	      the article. A revision edit can be considered as a
	      tuple containing the previous edit, the new edit and
	      its corresponding metadata. The goal of the classifier
	      is to output whether a particular edit made is good (no vandalism) or bad(vandalism).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The proposed method is to preprocess both (previous
	      and new) revision edits pertaing to a single edit to
	      remove the extra wiki markup and get pure text. Get
	      the difference in the pure texts and compute metadata,
	      text and language features which are then fed to the
	      classifier.

	    On-line social networking has become a very popular now a days. The <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/79287418/Watermarking-Social-Networking-Relational-Data-using-Non-numeric-Attribute">paper</a> studies the copyright issue of on-line social networking data in relational database. Techniques and concepts of mining for social network is discussed which gives rise to the need of watermarking its data. Proving ownership rights on such data is a crucial issue in social network which to some extent contribute to privacy preserving issue also. Watermark key is generated on vowel and consonant count and accordingly the profile image is scaled.
