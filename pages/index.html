	  </header>
	  <content>
	    <p>
	               I have served as a software developer for two years (Aug 2011 - Aug 2013) in Geometric
	      Limited, Pune. Some of the problems being continuously tackled in IT industry and most of
	      which I have encountered in my extensive stint as a software developer at Geometric Limited
	      are related to that of computation of exponentially increasing data. Research programs in the
	      fields of Networking, Distributed computing and that of Algorithm analysis are continuously
	      being carried out to tackle the ever increasing need of efficiency in computation speed and
	      time. With this need in mind my future goal is to pursue a career in IT industry and aim
	      towards computation on big data.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      I hold strong expertise in C++ and Java. I am currently a Teaching Assistant for the
	      course “Principles of Programming Languages” at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. For
	      the first semester of my Master’s degree I had taken up the following courses - Design and
	      Analysis of Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing. In the current
	      semester I have taken up Machine Learning, Computer Architecture and Semantic Web. I am
	      interested in applying Machine learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to process
	      data.
